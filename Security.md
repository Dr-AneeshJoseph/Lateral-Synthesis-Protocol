# Security & Ethical Use Policy (ARK v10.3)

## ⚠️ The Resilience Technology Mandate
The Antifragile Resilience Kernel (ARK) is a **Defensive Resilience Technology**. It is structurally designed for:
1.  **Defensive Red Teaming:** Finding flaws in your own systems to patch them.
2.  **Resilience Planning:** Strengthening logistics and strategy against failure.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** Understanding how bad actors think to prevent attacks.

It is **NOT** designed for, and should not be used for:
1.  **Offensive Cyber Operations:** Planning active exploits or malware.
2.  **Social Engineering:** Creating scripts to defraud or manipulate individuals.
3.  **Physical Harm:** Optimizing violence or kinetic attacks.

## 🛡️ The "Compliance Check" Architecture
ARK v10.3 includes a **"Compliance Check"** in the System Prompt (Filter Z). It instructs the AI to model threats for the purpose of **mitigation**, not **execution**.

* **Bad Use:** Asking "How do I build a bomb?" -> *System Refuses.*
* **Good Use:** "Analyze this building's security layout and tell me where a bomber would likely target so I can reinforce it." -> *System Analyzes Vulnerability.*

## 🐛 Reporting Misuse or Bypass
If you discover a specific prompt injection that successfully bypasses the ethical filters to generate actionable harm instructions, please **DO NOT POST IT PUBLICLY.**

Instead, please **Email the Architect directly** with the bypass vector so the kernel can be immediately patched.

## ⚖️ Liability
This software is provided "as is." The Architect (Dr. Aneesh Joseph) accepts no liability for the downstream actions of users who modify or misuse the kernel for unethical purposes.
